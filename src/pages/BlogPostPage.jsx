      <p>Selecting the perfect tile for your bathroom involves balancing aesthetics, functionality, and budget. Here are key factors to consider:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
        <li><strong>Water Resistance:</strong> Bathrooms are high-moisture environments. Porcelain tiles are virtually waterproof (absorption rate <0.5%), making them ideal. Glazed ceramic tiles are also suitable, while natural stone may require sealing.</li>
        <li><strong>Durability & Maintenance:</strong> Porcelain is highly durable and resists scratches and stains. Ceramic is also durable but can chip more easily. Natural stone varies in durability and often requires more maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Slip Resistance:</strong> Safety is paramount. Look for tiles with a higher coefficient of friction (COF) rating, especially for floor tiles. Textured finishes offer better grip than polished ones.</li>
        <li><strong>Size & Scale:</strong> Large-format tiles can make a small bathroom feel bigger due to fewer grout lines. Mosaics are great for shower floors (more grout lines = more grip) and accent walls.</li>
        <li><strong>Style & Aesthetics:</strong> Consider the overall design theme â€“ modern, traditional, rustic? Tile color, pattern, and finish play a huge role in achieving the desired look.</li>
        <li><strong>Grout:</strong> Choose a grout color that complements or contrasts your tiles. Consider epoxy grout for better stain and mold resistance, although it's more expensive and harder to install than traditional cement grout.</li>
        <li><strong>Budget:</strong> Prices vary significantly. Ceramic is often the most budget-friendly, followed by porcelain. Natural stone and high-end designer tiles can be considerably more expensive. Factor in installation costs too.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Consulting with a professional tiler can help you navigate these choices and ensure a beautiful, long-lasting result for your bathroom renovation.</p>

      <p>Grout does more than just fill the gaps between tiles; it provides structural support and prevents water ingress. The two main types are cement-based and epoxy grout. Here's a comparison:</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Cement-Based Grout</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
        <li><strong>Composition:</strong> A mixture of cement, water, and sometimes sand (sanded for wider joints, unsanded for narrower joints).</li>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> More affordable, easier to install and clean up during installation, wide range of colors.</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Porous (absorbs water and stains unless sealed), requires periodic sealing, prone to cracking over time, can harbor mold/mildew if not maintained.</li>
        <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Dry areas, budget-conscious projects, DIY installations.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Epoxy Grout</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
        <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Made from epoxy resins and a filler powder.</li>
        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Non-porous (waterproof and highly resistant to stains, chemicals, and grease), extremely durable, doesn't require sealing, inhibits mold/mildew growth, maintains color consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> More expensive, significantly harder and faster-setting during installation (less forgiving), can discolor porous tiles if not cleaned quickly, often has a slight plastic sheen.</li>
        <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Wet areas (showers, kitchens), high-traffic floors, areas requiring high hygiene standards, projects where longevity and low maintenance are key.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While epoxy grout offers superior performance, its challenging installation often makes it better suited for professional tilers. Cement grout remains a reliable option, especially when properly sealed and maintained.</p>

      <p>Tiling is constantly evolving. Here are some key trends shaping interior design in 2025:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
        <li><strong>Large-Format Tiles:</strong> Bigger tiles (e.g., 24x48 inches or larger) continue to gain popularity, creating a seamless look with fewer grout lines, especially on floors and shower walls.</li>
        <li><strong>Natural & Earthy Tones:</strong> Warm neutrals, terracotta, sage green, and deep blues are in vogue, bringing a sense of calm and connection to nature indoors.</li>
        <li><strong>Textured Finishes:</strong> Tiles with 3D patterns, fluted surfaces, or tactile finishes add depth and visual interest to walls. Think beyond smooth surfaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Pattern Play:</strong> Bold geometric patterns, updated subway tile layouts (vertical stacks, herringbone), and intricate mosaic designs are making a comeback as feature elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Terrazzo & Stone Looks:</strong> Porcelain tiles mimicking the look of terrazzo, marble, slate, and other natural stones offer durability and lower maintenance than the real thing.</li>
        <li><strong>Matte Finishes:</strong> While polished tiles still have their place, matte finishes are increasingly popular for a sophisticated, understated elegance. They also tend to show water spots and smudges less.</li>
        <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Look for tiles made from recycled materials or produced using eco-friendly manufacturing processes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Don't be afraid to mix and match trends or use tiles in unexpected ways, like tiling a ceiling or creating a tiled headboard. The key is to choose styles that resonate with your personal taste and complement your home's architecture.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Installation Timeline</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
        <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> 1 day for surface prep and layout planning.</li>
        <li><strong>Installation:</strong> 1-2 days for tile installation, depending on complexity.</li>
